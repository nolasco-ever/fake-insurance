# fake-insurance
This is a fake insurance quote platform made for agents and brokers created with ReactJS and NodeJS. This program utilizes the MERN stack (Mongoose, Express, React, Node) for the front end and the back end.<br>
<br>
Many different libraries were used along with React such as Redux for example. The purpose of this program is to allow an agent or a broker to view different insurance quotes that they have for their clients. They are able to delete and create as many as they want to. MongoDB Atlas was used as the backend and was connected to via the Express Node JS framework.
